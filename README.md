# Air-pollution

Project Summary:

Combatting urban air pollution, this IoT-based system monitors air quality in real-time using sensors like MQ135 and MQ6. The LCD displays PPM values, and the system triggers alarms when air quality deteriorates, saving logs for future analysis and intervention.

AIM:

The aim of this project is to develop an IoT-based system for monitoring urban air quality in real-time, utilizing sensors like MQ135 and MQ6. By accurately measuring air pollutants, the system aims to provide timely alerts and data for intervention to mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution on public health and the environment.

INTRODUCTION:

Urban air pollution poses a significant threat to public health and the environment, with pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter reaching hazardous levels in many cities worldwide. To address this pressing issue, there is a growing need for effective monitoring systems that can provide real-time data on air quality and trigger alarms when pollution levels exceed safe thresholds.

In response to this challenge, our project proposes the development of an IoT-based air quality monitoring system. This system utilizes sensors like MQ135 and MQ6 to measure key air pollutants and displays their concentration in parts per million (PPM) on an LCD screen. Moreover, the system is equipped with an alarm feature that activates when air quality deteriorates, alerting users to potential health risks.

REQUIREMENTS:

Hardware-MQ135 and MQ6 sensors, 
-microcontroller (e.g., Arduino), 
-LCD display, 
-alarm system components.
Software:-Arduino IDE, 
-Jupyter Notebook.

ADVANTAGES:

-Real-Time Monitoring: Provides instant updates on air quality, allowing for prompt responses to deteriorating conditions.
-Early Warning System: Triggers alarms when pollution levels exceed safe thresholds, helping to protect public health.
-Data Logging: Records air quality data for future analysis, facilitating informed decision-making and intervention planning.
-Cost-Effective: Utilizes affordable sensors and microcontrollers, making the system accessible for deployment in various urban settings.
-Scalability: Can be scaled up to cover larger areas or integrated into existing urban infrastructure for comprehensive air quality monitoring.

CONCLUSION:

In conclusion, the development of an IoT-based air quality monitoring system holds great promise for combating urban air pollution and safeguarding public health. By leveraging sensors like MQ135 and MQ6, this system provides real-time monitoring, early warnings, and data logging capabilities, enabling timely interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution. With its cost-effectiveness and scalability, this technology has the potential to make significant contributions to improving air quality in urban environments.
